Universal File System Interface Error Heirarchy
===============================================

All UFSI errors must take a string ``message`` and an optional
``causedBy`` exception object. They must all implement the __str__
method and a getCausedBy method to return the causedBy exception.


* Error - base class for all UFSI errors

  - InvalidPathError - give path and type that path was thought to be
    a reason why it doesn't match would be ideal

  - UnsupportedOperationError - raised when an operation cannot be
    performed on the specified file system.

  - AuthorisationError - base class for authorisation related errors

    + AuthorisationRequiredError - raised when a method requires some
      form of authorisation to perform a request.

    + AuthorisationInvalidError - raised when the authentication
      provided is rejected as invalid

  - IOError - base class for io errors

    + PathNotFoundError - when a path (file or dir doesn't exist on
      the file system

    + EOFError - end of the file

    + TimeoutError - for when a request times out
