Universal File System Interface

(C)opyRight 2005 Adam Kerz


Ufsi defines a standard interface for
providing access to various file systems. It also contains
various implementations of the interface.


Currently installation is a manual process of putting the src/ufsi
directory and its contents into the site-packages directory of
python's lib directory.

Eg:
On Unix:

  /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages

On Windows:

  C:\Python\lib\site-packages


(or by creating/modifying user.pth in that directory.)


For a sample of how to use it you can find a limited example in:

  src/test/testUfsi.py
